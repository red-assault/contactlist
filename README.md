# contactlist
Creating a CRUD application with the help of MEAN stack.
I am a beginner and I am working to create a C(create) R(read) U(update) D(delete) or CRUD application with the help of MEAN stack but I am unable to understand the error it is showing as I am almost there to finish my code (I have not completed the front end part yet... It is half done). 
I am using Visual Studio Code as my editor . 

# Under the file contactlist\client\src\app\contacts it is showing an error :-
      {
	 "resource": "/e:/project/contactlist/client/src/app/contacts/contacts.component.ts",
	"owner": "typescript",
	"code": "2306",
	"severity": 8,
	"message": "File 'e:/project/contactlist/client/types/@angular/core.d.ts' is not a module.",           //Error 
	"source": "ts",
	"startLineNumber": 1,
	"startColumn": 35,
	"endLineNumber": 1,
	"endColumn": 50
     }


  I have tried various things by searching the solution online but nothing works . Hope someone can fix it.
